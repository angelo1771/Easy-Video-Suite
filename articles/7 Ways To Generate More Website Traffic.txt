Press Releases

If it is written well enough you can then have it be picked up by top search engines such as yahoo and google.

Affiliate Programs

If you sell a product or e-book on your website you should set up an affiliate program. This will allow visitors the chance to join your affiliate program and sell your product for you. Now you have a business within a business and this will allow you to receive more website traffic.

Joint Venture

If you team up with a company that sells similar products, you can swap links and promote each others’ business as well. This will allow you to get more website traffic from their site to yours.
