SUBJECT: Lesson #4 - Distributing Your Videos

{!firstname_fix}

Once you have a series of hot videos in your arsenal, it's time
to distribute them to the world! Once you unleash your videos,
you'll begin to see traffic coming in very quickly, as these
video community sites and media hot spots are filled with new
visitors every single day.

The leader in video marketplaces is YouTube.com so it's
important that you include it in all of your video marketing
campaigns, however there are many other places where you should
focus on getting your video circulated, including: 

Break.com
DailyMotion.com
MetaCafe.com
Veoh.com

Distributing is very easy, but you'll need to create an account
with each video site before you can upload your video. 

Also keep in mind that many of these video networks will
manually review and approve your video before it's published, so
it might take a few hours before all of your videos are online.

You can automate the process by signing up for an account with
Tube Mogul at TubeMogul.com , an online video distribution
service that will push your video message out to hundreds of
popular video communities.
