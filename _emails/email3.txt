{!firstname_fix}

Now, here's what I'm going to show you how to not only simplify
the process of creating videos but how to AUTOMATE distribution!

There's a secret weapon online that will give you the
opportunity to develop dozens of high quality videos in a matter
of seconds, and best of all, you can use this video production
suite to repurpose content, so that your videos are created from
existing articles you've already written!

Keep in mind that your videos don't have to be length
productions. 

Even 3 minute videos can do wonders at generating fresh interest
and exposure for your product, so start off by developing simple
video presentations and as you become more familiar with how
your viewers respond to your videos, you can begin to tailor
them towards better communicating with your target audience.

Article Video Robot will help you get started, and then you can
spend time learning how to create powerful video presentations
yourself, as you can continue to grow your business.

If you simply aren't ready to develop your own videos, consider
outsourcing the project to a qualified video developer. 

There are plenty of places to seek out some help, including
marketing forums such as http://forums.digitalpoint.com and

requesting help via the freelance marketplaces, including
