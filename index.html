  <p>A lot of marketers find it difficult to convert their hard earned website traffic into sales, and it can be a really frustrating situation to be in ... when you see visitors coming to your website (often after paying a lot of time and money to get them there), only to watch them click away and never sign up to your lists or buy from you.</p>
<p>If you ever want to make big money from the Internet, you need to find a way to convert your visitors into subscribers and buyers ... and fast!</p>
  <p>One of the biggest issues, which is causing a lack of sales, is the lack of trust your visitors have in you. They've got no reason to believe what you say, they don't know who you are, and ultimately people who feel like this towards you are never going to give you money.</p>
  <p>Marketers realise this, and the web is changing fast to solve this problem. You may have noticed that as more more people use modern technology on their websites, your old textbased websites are starting to look dated and dull. More to the point, it's very hard to trust a website that has only got text on it.</p>
  <h2>In the old days, sales were made by people knocking on doors and speaking face-to-face with people... </h2>
  <p>And that psychology has never died, in fact ... it's becoming more and more essential on the Internet.</p>
  <p>But how do you speak face-to-face with somebody when you live in a different country, and they are visiting your website 3 AM and you're in bed?</p>
  <p><strong>The answer, is video.</strong></p>
  <p>The web is becoming more transparent, and people want to know who they're buying from. Just like in the olden days, where salesmen would visit people face-to-face ... video allows a very close replication of that sales situation.</p>
  <p>the buyer can see your face (or at least hear your voice), they can trust you are a real person, they can share your sarcasm and humour, they can get a clear idea of who you are and how genuine you are... something that text alone cannot do.</p>
  <p>I'm not saying that text only based websites don't work any more, but <strong>video is quickly taking over the web</strong> and those that get left behind will struggle to compete when it comes to making sales and getting subscribers.</p>
  <h2>With video, it allows you to build trust with your visitors (and build a relationship where they end up buying from you). </h2>
  <p>It allows you to express yourself in ways that text alone cannot (which can increase sales and keep people's attention)</p>
  <p>Plus, the viral nature of videos<strong> allows people to share your content</strong>, and get you more traffic as a result. There's just so many things you can do with video that you cannot do with text only websites. </p>
  <p>But the biggest thing of all, <strong>is that it's easy to keep people's attention</strong>, <strong>teach them things</strong>,<strong> connect on a personal level</strong>... <strong>all without having to take up pages and pages on your website. </strong></p>
  <p>It really is the most efficient, proven way to get a response from your website visitors.</p>
  <h2>But here's the problem with video...</h2>
  <p>For many years, marketers have avoided putting video on their websites because it has always been technically confusing and requires <strong>a lot of hassle and work</strong> (especially when trying to put video in WordPress blog posts!). </p>
  <p>But as video technology becomes more common, more and more marketers are getting in on the act are reaping the rewards in terms of more subscribers and more sales. <strong>You only have to look at some of the recent launches in the Internet marketing industry, to see how crucial video is to making sales. </strong></p>
  <p>Those long sales pages are either being pushed to the bottom of the page with video at the top ... or completely replaced with video only. </p>
  <p>There is a reason why all the big marketers are doing this... because it works. If it didn't, then you wouldn't keep seeing them doing it over and over again for each product launch and promotion.</p>
  <p>It's not just our Internet marketing community either ... <strong>video is taking over the entire web</strong>, you have to look at YouTube's popularity for clarification of that. The bottom line is that people consume video much more comfortably than reading lots of text.</p>
  <p>But the problem with video, is that even when marketers do get their videos on their site, <strong>the video hardly ever plays back properly</strong> because they <strong>take up too much bandwidth</strong> for the average visitor to be able to handle. </p>
  <p>That's why people started using hosting services for video... such as Amazon S3. <strong>The problem is, Amazon S3 was (and often still is) a technical nightmare to set up.</strong></p>
  <p>Even if you manage to get over the technical hurdles of putting video on your website, <strong>getting people to actually buy or sign up to your newsletter as a result of watching your videos was a whole new problem in itself.</strong></p>
  <h2>But as technology moves on, solutions to these problems are beginning to emerge...</h2>
  <p>One of those technologies is Easy Video Suite. Recently described as &quot;the birth of video marketing 2.0&quot;, <strong>Easy Video Suite allows you to capture your prospects at the very moment in which they are most likely to take action</strong>, <strong>by inserting Aweber opt-in forms and order buttons INSIDE your videos.</strong></p>
  <p>Easy Video Suite also includes a number of<strong> viral sharing features</strong>, allowing your new customers to share your video with thousands of people across the globe - maintaining the quality of your message with an opt-in form or payment button effortlessly propelling them to take targeted action.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, you'll be able to <strong>quickly insert videos into any website that you want to</strong>, and get those videos to generate clicks, opt ins and sales... without having to hire a professional web designer, I.T team or copywriter.</p>
  <p>Furthermore,<strong> your videos will play back seamlessly</strong> as a result of the Amazon S3 integration feature, which allows you to upload your videos to Amazon's ultrafast servers, and seamlessly link them to your videos... with point-and-click simplicity.</p>
  <p>For years, this was a mystery that only the most technical savvy web designers and I.T guys could understand.  </p>
  <h2>It does all that by using the following features...</h2>
  <p>1. Instantly and automatically send your video viewers to any website, shopping card of affiliate promotion after your video stops playing. No need to prompt your prospect to &quot;click the link below&quot; anymore. EVP makes it easier than ever for your customers to buy from you!</p>
  <p>2. Explode sales and increase profits by embedding &quot;buy now&quot; buttons directly into your videos! Your call-to-action no longer requires your visitors to complete fifty steps.. Finally capitalize on psychology by enticing your visitor when they're most likely to make a purchase.</p>
  <p>3. Quickly and easily capture e-mail addresses and generate leads, by adding opt-in forms inside your videos. Your viral video is now a self-contained squeeze page dedicated to turbo-charging your list building for lightning-fast profits!</p>
  <p>4. Easily create and protect &quot;member only&quot; videos with a few clicks of the mouse. Imagine thousands of dollars in lost revenue you can now avoid completely by ensuring only paid customers can gain access to exclusive content...</p>
  <p>5. Publish your videos on ANY website within seconds. With just a couple of easy steps (copy and paste) you can quickly get your videos online without ever having to worry about them not working properly. Saving you time AND money.</p>
  <p>6. Use the quality servers at Amazon S3 to quickly and securely host your videos for pennies! It previously cost excessive monthly fees and was virtually impossible to use Amazon to embed videos because your viewers were left waiting. Not any more! </p>
  <p>Along with the main video software, you also get for training and software support. But furthermore, as part of your purchase, you also get a free 30 day access pass to the IM Mastermind Club, which is valued at $37 and contains lots of information from a wide variety of Internet marketing topics.</p>
