There are a lot of reliable ways to jumpstart your traffic flows, though most of them would cost some money. In this article I'd like to tell you about my favorite web promotion tactics, which wouldn't cost you a single cent. Moreover, some of them will save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. The first tactic alone can generate you over $2,000 equivalent of free targeted traffic.

Well, here are the seven surefire technics capable of skyrocketing your traffic starting from today.

1) Free Pay Per Click (PPC) Advertising That Works 

The Adwords by Google, Yahoo's Overture and many other PPC search engines provide great sources of targeted Internet. They are very truly popular among web marketers. However, as the PPC search engine managers wish to expand their customer base so they need to convince people like you that pay per click advertising really works. 

Here are the good news, there are dozens of PPC search engines who will give you up to $100 in free credits to prove that pay per click advertising will work for you. To claim your credits all you need do is visit the various engines and web directories and sign-up. There are no catches and it won't cost you anything except your time. 

It couldn't be simpler to obtain such free PPC advertising. The table at this page: http://www.affiliated-business.com/promotion/Pay-Per-Click5.html lists over 60 Pay Per Click Search Engines offering in excess of $2,000 of free web promotion credits. One after another select the PPC search engines form the list, click on the links to open the corresponding sign-up pages and sign up for your free adverising accounts.

2) Use Profitable Keywords Or Keyword Niches For Your Site's Content 

Generally, internet users use search engines to find what they are looking for. Search engines in return use keyword rankings to give away relevant search results. If you'd like your site to appear at the top lines of search engine results, you must use proper keywords and keyword phrases. 

Try to employ the most profitable (of higher demand) keywords at your site content. You could write your own content or you could hire someone to do it for you. If you're writing content on yourself you have to make it more entertaining as well as informative. 

In doing so, you can get high rankings in search engine results and strong incoming traffic without any costs.

3) Exchange Links With Partner Sites 

Another great idea is trading links with partner (or even competitor) sites. This works well especially when both sites feature the same niche. 

Exchanging or trading links with other sites, both of them could benefit. When one site features another sites link, they will provide one another with the traffic they both generate. 

The efforts are doubly beneficial because it seems like both sides are working to generate doubly enhanced traffic. The more links exchanged with more sites the more traffic could be expected. 

And again, you don't have to spend a cent. All you have to do is to communicate to another webmaster and to reach with him an agreement.

4) Write Articles And Publish Them Across The Internet 

There are a lot of sites that offer free submission and posting of your articles. You'd better to s ubmit articles to sites containing the same subject that your site deals in. If you sell computers write press releases and articles about computers and computer parts. Try to provide helpful tips guides and good advice. Writing articles that contain good service and knowledge would bring the necessary mileage your traffic flow needs. 

When people find in your article something of interest, you have good chances of following the track by finding out where the article originated. It lasts for you just to a ttach a brief description of your site or service at the end of the article and to include a link.

5) Join Forums, Blogs And Other Online Communities 

You can take advantage of online forums, blogs and web communities. The great thing about forums and online communities is that you can target a certain group that fits the certain demographic that you are looking for. You can discuss about lots of things about the goodsor services that you represent or offer. 

With online communities and forums you can build a reputation for your company. You must capture the market niche you represent and show your expertise and credibility. When you created a good foundation for your site, people will trust you and your web business. Your customers will pass on their trust and credibility to many people all over the Internet. Traffic will certainly increase because they know that you can provide what they need.

6) Offer Newsletters Or eZines 

You can also make use of newsletters. Provide people with a catalog of your products and interesting useful articles. If your texts are really interesting and entertaining, more people will sign up for your newsletter and recommend it to other people. The more people who signs up for your newsletter, the more people there will be willing to visit your site. So, if you arouse the curiosity of your customers they would be pushed to help you growing your traffic.

7) Use Advantages Of Viral Marketing 

Viral marketing is a promotional method that allows you to spread the word about your company and product without any costs. All it takes is to bring a great idea, a good addicting game, a funny story; many ideas are still out there. Create a gossip or a buzz, many web projects are advertised by using scandals and rumors to make them more popular. 

Also you can provide your web site visitors with content they wouldn't read anywhere else. People will stay longer at your web site to read the original content. With this method, people get infected with the creativity and entertainment of the website content and they will pass it on to many people. 

Each of the above mentioned methods can drive streams of free traffic to your website. All it takes is a bit of effort and extended man hours. Learn all you can about the techniques depicted here and you will soon have a site with a great traffic flow without the usual costs that come with it.
